# TODO
Cleanup tasks:

- header.tsx split into subcomponents. It is large. mobile and desktop components which is used in header.tsx?
- Link replace a href. login and register. maybe other places too.
- GeneralError component extraction. Hardcoded error text and use boolean generalError values to determine show error or not
- Strip uneeded from homepage: my collection, recent activity, view collection and sign out button at bottom of page.
- header.tsx or subcomponents. Wrap logic in custom hooks and write tests for them. Dependent on first task in todo.
- Add wine tests
- Search wine tests
